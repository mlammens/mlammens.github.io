<p>For one of my courses this semester I&rsquo;m using Blackboard Grade Center to have students submit their assignments and for me to assess them. I actually prefer to assess/correct assignments with old-fashioned pen and paper; I think it&rsquo;s a bit quicker. But every semester I&rsquo;m faced with a pile of correcting, whether electronic or physical, I try to start by using e-grading. One thing I&rsquo;m noticing is that my students don&rsquo;t necessarily seem too engaged with my feedback I&rsquo;ve provided through the Grade Center. Admittedly, it&rsquo;s a bit clunky. They have to download a pdf and click on my comment bubbles. It&rsquo;s entirely possible that I&rsquo;m misusing this Blackboard feature, after all, I&rsquo;m pretty new to it. Nevertheless, I&rsquo;m left wondering if handing back a physical copy of an assignment, with my ink on it, results in the students who wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily bother downloading the pdf having a look at what I had to say about there answers.</p>
