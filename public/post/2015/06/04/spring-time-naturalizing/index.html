<p>Every year, when spring comes, I get pretty excited to get outside and do some naturalizing. Well, mostly botanizing. I don&rsquo;t consider myself a particularly good naturalist. I can&rsquo;t walk through the forests close to home and spout off the names of all the plants around me - common or binomial. I can name the most prominent ones. I can usually identify the habitat I&rsquo;m in. But overall, I have a lot improving to do. And each spring brings the promise that I can practice, and get a little better. However, I&rsquo;ve been a little short on time this spring. I&rsquo;m trying to wrap up several projects I&rsquo;ve been working on for my postdoc, because I&rsquo;ll be ending that sooner than I had expected to take a new position this fall. But last week I had the chance to get out for a bit, and I was actually pretty happy with how much I remembered from years past! More importantly, I got out into the northeast (North American) forests, and had time to just look around. I wasn&rsquo;t running or hiking, just looking, identifying a few plants, refreshing my memory, and thinking about forest structure, associated species, etc.. In years to come, my research focus will be moving back to these forests (though I&rsquo;ll still be working on CFR projects as well), so it&rsquo;s good to be reintroduced, and get that spark to open up <a href="http://newenglandwild.org/store/books-from-the-society/flora-novae-angliae">Flora Novae Angliae</a> and just poke around the pages a bit.</p>
