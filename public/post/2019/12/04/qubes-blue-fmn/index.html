<p>This fall I participated in my second <a href="https://qubeshub.org/community/fmns">QUBES Faculty Mentoring Network</a>, this time working along side several other educators to implement and/or develop learning modules associated with the <a href="https://www.biodiversityliteracy.com/">Biodiversity Literacy in Undergraduate Education (BLUE) network</a>. I chose to adapt an existing module to implement in my Introduction to Statistics for Life Science course, and still have intentions of creating a new module for our last week of new material coming up.</p>

<h2 id="data-is-the-new-science-remixed">Data is the New Science - remixed</h2>

<p>The module I chose to implement was the <a href="https://qubeshub.org/qubesresources/publications/1138/1">Data is the New Science</a> module, which was designed to introduce students to biodiversity data sources and encourage them to interact with the information that can be acquired from these sources. I remixed this module to have my students also become familiar with these sources, to practice working with basic summary statistics, and to work with visualizing data in multiple ways. One major distinction between my module (which I turned into an in class assignment) is that I had the students carry out each of the data acquisition and analysis steps using the R statistical computing language. To do so, I took advantage of several opensource packages, including <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ridigbio/index.html"><code>ridigbio</code></a> and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgbif/index.html"><code>rgif</code></a>.</p>

<h3 id="why-an-r-remix">Why an R remix?</h3>

<p>The course that I implemented this module in, as noted above, was a biostats course. One of the main outcomes of the course is that the students become familiar with using R (via RStudio) to perform the analyses common in the fields of biology and environmental science. As such, I try to use R in just about all of our class assignments. Also, I use R in my personal research to gather, visualize, and analyze biodiversity data all of the time. So part of my motivation was to show my students that they too can use the same techniques as someone else they see as a &ldquo;scientist&rdquo;.</p>
