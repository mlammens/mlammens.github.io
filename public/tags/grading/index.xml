      <description>For one of my courses this semester I&amp;rsquo;m using Blackboard Grade Center to have students submit their assignments and for me to assess them. I actually prefer to assess/correct assignments with old-fashioned pen and paper; I think it&amp;rsquo;s a bit quicker. But every semester I&amp;rsquo;m faced with a pile of correcting, whether electronic or physical, I try to start by using e-grading. One thing I&amp;rsquo;m noticing is that my students don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily seem too engaged with my feedback I&amp;rsquo;ve provided through the Grade Center.</description>
