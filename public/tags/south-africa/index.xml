      <description>A little less than a month ago, I took my second trip to South Africa. Last year I spent nearly seven weeks there, collecting field data that we&amp;rsquo;re currently in the process of analyzing. It was an amazing experience, and given the length of time I was there, I felt like I was pretty immersed in the region. In contrast, this year I was in country for only seven days - two teaching a Software Carpentry workshop, one playing tourist, and three at a symposium our research group organized.</description>
