      <description>I started graduate school in 2007 with the intention of becoming a conservation biologist. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I had a good sense for what that meant at the time, given my lack of experience, but I knew that I wanted to work toward science that protected natural places and the organisms in them. So, it seemed logical that the first scientific meeting I would attend would be the Congress for Conservation Biology - the 2008 international meeting in Chattanooga to be exact.</description>
