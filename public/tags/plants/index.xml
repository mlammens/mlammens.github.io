      <description>A few weeks ago I went to the New York Botanical Garden for the Native Plant Symposium. Overall, it was a good experience. The organizers put together a great line-up of speakers, and I thought each presentation was interesting and thought provoking. One aspect of this symposium that was interesting to me was that it was targeted towards a fairly general audience. The talks were not like those you would see at ESA, though in a few cases new research was presented.</description>

      <description>Every year, when spring comes, I get pretty excited to get outside and do some naturalizing. Well, mostly botanizing. I don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself a particularly good naturalist. I can&amp;rsquo;t walk through the forests close to home and spout off the names of all the plants around me - common or binomial. I can name the most prominent ones. I can usually identify the habitat I&amp;rsquo;m in. But overall, I have a lot improving to do.</description>
