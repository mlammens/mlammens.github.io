# Website for Matthew Aiello-Lammens

This is my website. I've used the Lanyon theme to build this
site. Below are a few pieces I left from the Lanyon README,
primarily to make it very clear that I have benefitted from
someone else work.

# Lanyon (this content from original Lanyon README.md

Lanyon is an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

## Development

Lanyon has two branches, but only one is used for active development.

- `master` for development.  **All pull requests should be to submitted against `master`.**
- `gh-pages` for our hosted site, which includes our analytics tracking code. **Please avoid using this branch.**
