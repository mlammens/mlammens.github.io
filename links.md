## Documents of Interest

* [Stats Primer - Teacher Training for Independent Science Research](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HiyS88EFPNIh9JkLuuchAlxD2-0Mgd60wCT56en497g/edit?usp=sharing) - This is a Google Sheet I put together to help teach statistics that would be valuable to high school science teachers who advise/teach independent research.

## Other sites I also work on, from time-to-time

* [My Biostats site](https://mlammens.github.io/Biostats) - I put materials and thoughts related to biostats here. Most of these materials are in support of classes I teach.

* [My plant ID log](http://ecologistatwork.blogspot.com/) - When I have the time, I like to write about my process of becoming a better plant ecologist, which mostly means identifying plants right now.
