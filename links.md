## Documents of Interest

* [Stats Primer - Teacher Training for Independent Science Research](docs/stats_primer.md)

## Other sites I also work on, from time-to-time

* [My Biostats site](https://mlammens.github.io/Biostats) - I put materials and thoughts related to biostats here. Most of these materials are in support of classes I teach.

* [My plant ID log](http://ecologistatwork.blogspot.com/) - When I have the time, I like to write about my process of becoming a better plant ecologist, which mostly means identifying plants right now.
