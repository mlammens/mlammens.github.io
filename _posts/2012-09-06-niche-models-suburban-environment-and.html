I use ecological niche models and species distribution models fairly extensively in my research - both my thesis work and side projects. &nbsp;For some time now my advisor has been involved in projects that link these types of models with population projection models, so when I was thinking about researching the patterns and processes of the invasion of Glossy buckthorn, it made sense to me that I would employ similar techniques. &nbsp;Additionally, I have only found a dozen or so unique presence records for Glossy buckthorn here on Long Island, so I thought it may be good do a SDM focused just on the island here. &nbsp;I haven't completed this part of my project, so don't get excited, I don't have any results to share with you yet. &nbsp;Anyhow, I've spent a fair bit of time gathering more&nbsp;occurrence&nbsp;locations from&nbsp;numerous&nbsp;public lands (parks and what not) in Nassau and Suffolk County, and had been thinking that carrying out an SDM would be pretty straight forward.<br /><br />SIDE BAR: Looking for invasive species is a bit funny for me. &nbsp;When I go to a new location that I think is likely to have buckthorn, I'm giddy with anticipation. &nbsp;I'm excited when I find it and disappointed when I don't. &nbsp;Now, objectively speaking, if buckthorn is in fact having a strong negative effect on native ecosystems (most likely the case in my New Hampshire populations), then shouldn't I be happy when I don't find it? Yeah, it's complicated I guess...<br /><br />Ok, back to modeling, and how spending time in the field has affected my thinking. &nbsp;One thing I tend to think about often when in the field is how Glossy buckthorn got to that particular spot? &nbsp;Where is the nearest, next-oldest, population? &nbsp;Glossy buckthorn seeds can be dispersed by any one of the many bird species that eat its fruit, but not too far. &nbsp;The fruit has a laxative effect (<a href="http://botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/b/buckth80.html" target="_blank">on humans too</a>), so birds don't hold it, or the seeds, for long. &nbsp;Because nearly all of my field sites are embedded in suburban areas, they all have at least some length of border shared with someones backyard. &nbsp;At my Long Island sites, I can see backyards from many of my plots. &nbsp;Initially I hadn't thought much of this, but while visiting my uncle and his family in New Jersey a while I back, I noticed that there in the unmaintained garden next to the patio there was a Glossy buckthorn tree. &nbsp;Me - "Uncle Joe, did you plant that tree?" Uncle Joe - "Oh no, that came with the house." So there you have it, people in the suburbs may be inclined to plant this tree in there backyard.<br /><br />What are the implications of this on my models and how I use them? &nbsp;I'm not sure yet. &nbsp;On the one hand, it makes me think of possible uses of high-res remote sensing and how it may be used to determine what types of plants are growing in urban and suburban yards. &nbsp;This technology and its applications are improving rapidly, and we are getting to the point that identification of individual species from&nbsp;satellite&nbsp;imagery may be possible. &nbsp;(Yeah, that's crazy!) On the other hand, can I use the results of my distribution models to identify distances between populations if plants in your neighbors backyard are actually the source for my populations? &nbsp;I'm not sure, and will definitely be giving this more thought as the project progresses in the near future.
