title: New Site
---

This is a new website for me. I've begun the migration from my
[Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/site/mattlammens/) and
[Blogger](http://ecologistatwork.blogspot.com/) pages to a Jekyll
powered,
[Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) themed site hosted from my 
GitHub account. 

### Why move?

There are a few reasons for the move:

1. I'm attracted to the simplicity of writing both my site and
my blog in simple text (i.e., Markdown). 
2. Related to 1, I think that simple text will make it more likely 
that I write more.
3. Over the past two years I've written many short pieces using RMarkdown
and knitr - I would really like a simple way to share some of these.
