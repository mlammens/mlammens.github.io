<div><br /></div>So last I left off on the topic of <a href="http://ecologistatwork.blogspot.com/2012/07/on-how-i-chose-my-samples-part-1.html" target="_blank">choosing samples</a>&nbsp;I was discussing how I realized that I really needed to have a good look around me and think about what I was trying to accomplish in order to help me come up with a sampling scheme. &nbsp;And for the most part, that's just what I did. &nbsp;During my field visits in the Summer and Fall of 2009, and even somewhat during field visits in 2010, I spent several hours standing in patches of Glossy Buckthorn thinking about how best to select plants to tag and follow. &nbsp;Sometimes I would call my friend Adam (also studying plant ecology at the time) and bounce ideas off of him (or ask him to generate random numbers for me). &nbsp;Sometimes I would call my wife and complain about the dense blackberry bushes, multi-flora rose, ticks, etc - ya know, sometimes you just need to whine a bit.<br /><br />Here are a few of the standout observations that helped me develop my sampling scheme:<br /><br /><ul><li>Glossy buckthorn patches vary in density and I wanted to avoid over-representing plants in areas of high density or under-representing plants in areas of low density</li><li>For the purposes of my study I want to follow individuals, therefore areas that are bare of Glossy buckthorn are not good places to look for plants to follow (yeah - this one is obvious)</li><li>Glossy buckthorn grows in varying ecological conditions (under story, gaps, riparian zones, uplands, etc.) and my samples should come from as many of these conditions as is feasible</li><li>The ecological conditions mentioned above are generally clumped. That is, the ecological conditions I'm interested in usually make up their own patch (e.g. a large patch of understory or wetland)</li></ul><div>With these observations and thoughts in mind, I decide that the most important aspect of my sampling scheme should be that I select individual plants to follow across different plant densities and in different ecological conditions. &nbsp;So here's the final sampling scheme I chose:</div><div><ul><li>Ecological conditions - I selected a specific combination of ecological conditions (e.g. upland-understory forest) and using a GPS outlined the borders of a Glossy buckthorn infestation <b>within</b> the bounds of the borders of the ecological condition.</li><li>Individual plants - Once I had the border of an infestation, I selected 15 to 20 random points within these bounds where I set up 2x2m plots, or quadrats. &nbsp;Within these plots, I tagged and measured all Glossy buckthorn plants that were taller than 10cm. Plants smaller than 10cm were considered saplings, which were sampled differently.</li></ul><div>This type of sample scheme is essentially a stratified-random design, stratified across ecological condition and random within that condition. &nbsp;So far I think it has worked out pretty well.</div></div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FqVR2bECAHw/UD48E_RRzXI/AAAAAAAABz4/5IcuuDsUwLA/s1600/DSCN0999.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FqVR2bECAHw/UD48E_RRzXI/AAAAAAAABz4/5IcuuDsUwLA/s1600/DSCN0999.JPG" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Random 2x2m plot in a large forest gap.
