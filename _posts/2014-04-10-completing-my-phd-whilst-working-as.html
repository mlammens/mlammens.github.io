Just over a week ago I defended my PhD. Almost 10 months ago I started my Post Doc. This shuffling of the order in which one "should" progress is not uncommon. I know at least a few other people who started their post doc, then went back to their PhD institution to defend. About four weeks ago, as I was finishing up my dissertation to send it off to my committee, I would say that I wasn't sure it was a good idea to take a post doc before you finish. The past 10 months have certainly been challenging. Going into it, I figured that I could probably work between 60 and 80 hours a week. After all, there are so many hours in the day. Start my post doc work at 7 AM, finish up around 4 PM, that still leaves me 6 to 7 hours of work time before I need to go to sleep. I quickly realized that was pretty naive. Perhaps some can work that hard for extended periods of time, but likely not many (as this post at Dynamic Ecology suggests&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/1kD6KzG">http://bit.ly/1kD6KzG</a>). This meant that it took me longer to complete my dissertation than I initially anticipated. But now, looking through the rose tinted glasses that come with a successful defense, it's easy to think, "oh yes, this was definitely a good idea". So, I thought I might list a few pros and cons, based on my experience.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* My post doc is in a lab I had been following for some time, focusing on research that is incredibly interesting to me, with excellent colleagues - hard to beat that.<br />* I work close enough to home, in a flexible enough environment, to partially solve the two body problem. (My wife has a faculty position at a medical school on Long Island. We don't want to live separately and I would never ask her to leave her position so I can take a three year temporary position.)<br />* I am going to get to go to the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa! How cool is that?<br />* Working on my post doc gave me a wider view of the field of plant ecology, which helped me frame my PhD work as I was finishing up. In general, there was a great deal of reciprocal transfer of knowledge (in my own head) between my post doc project and my PhD work.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* No free time, or almost none. I turned down a lot of invitations from family and friends over the past ten months, and always felt guilty when I didn't.<br />* As I said above, the time to completion for my PhD was extended. This was perhaps the greatest challenge.<br />* Hours wise, I'm pretty confident that I was fulfilling my post doc obligations, but I wasn't as efficient or as productive as I wanted to be. In part I think this was because my intellectual energy was split,<br />* I did not publish my chapters as I completed them, leaving me with three unpublished dissertation chapters (but perhaps it will be nice to have manuscripts almost ready to submit over the next year.)<br /><br />Where to now? I'm excited to devote most of my energy to my post doc work (I have to reserve some to wrap up side projects that I let languish), and I'm optimistic about what I can accomplish in the next year and a half. I wouldn't be in this position if I had waited until I was finished to take a post doc. With that said, I have every intention on giving my future students a realistic portrayal of what this decision can feel like. And given the number of finishing PhD students who start their post docs early, I assume they too will do what they think is best for them at that time, just like I did.

    Congrats on a successful defense, Dr. Aiello-Lammens!
