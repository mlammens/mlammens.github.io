<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
<div><p dir=ltr>I'm lacking time to do a fuller post these days, which is sad because I have several ideas bouncing around my head. I'll try to make some time later this week. In the mean time, this is just a quick note to say that I'm very curious what, if any, the affect of Hurricane Sandy will be on my Long Island field plots. I finished this season's work in the UNH area about a week and a half ago, and was planning to visit Caleb Smith last week, but obviously that plan was changed. For now, Caleb Smith is closed to the public, so it may be some time before I can finish this year's work. I'll do a post once I collect this data. Everyone stay safe for now.</p></div>
