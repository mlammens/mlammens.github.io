I moved over all of my old posts from [my old Blogger blog](http://ecologistatwork.blogspot.com/). Old posts are tagged in the title with the word (archive). Personally, I have nothing against blogger, and has [I wrote elsewhere](_posts/2015-03-10-new-site.md), I simply wanted to move the blog over to GitHub/Jekyll because I thought it might facilitate more writing. I'll have to tweak some formatting on the old posts, but most things came over easily enough thanks to the scripts I found [here](https://github.com/coolaj86/blogger2jekyll). Another example of the awesomeness that is code sharing. Thanks to coolaj86!
