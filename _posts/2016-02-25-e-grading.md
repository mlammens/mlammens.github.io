title: Does e-grading lead to less student engagement with feedback?
comments: True
---

For one of my courses this semester I'm using Blackboard Grade Center to have students submit their assignments and for me to assess them. I actually prefer to assess/correct assignments with old-fashioned pen and paper; I think it's a bit quicker. But every semester I'm faced with a pile of correcting, whether electronic or physical, I try to start by using e-grading. One thing I'm noticing is that my students don't necessarily seem too engaged with my feedback I've provided through the Grade Center. Admittedly, it's a bit clunky. They have to download a pdf and click on my comment bubbles. It's entirely possible that I'm misusing this Blackboard feature, after all, I'm pretty new to it. Nevertheless, I'm left wondering if handing back a physical copy of an assignment, with my ink on it, results in the students who wouldn't necessarily bother downloading the pdf having a look at what I had to say about there answers.
