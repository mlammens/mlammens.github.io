The White Mountains of New Hampshire is the place that inspired me to study ecology. So when I was coming up with my PhD project I wanted at least some of my field work to be in this region. &nbsp;(As an aside, one of the bonuses of the PhD program at Stony Brook is that you can develop a project independent of your adviser's research program, so to some extent, you can choose where you want to work.) In fact, while I was developing my project, I contacted the Botanist for the White Mountain National Forest and asked him if there were any non-native plant species he thought were particularly concerning. &nbsp; Glossy buckthorn - that was his first answer. &nbsp;So as I've described a bit <a href="http://ecologistatwork.blogspot.com/2012/07/on-how-i-chose-my-samples-part-1.html" target="_blank">here</a>, in 2009 I set up my first transect about a 1/2 mile or so from the trailhead of the Winniweta&nbsp;Falls Trail.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j-6mLFn2wvE/UK_VUoDF0LI/AAAAAAAAB04/lD_H3x13W8E/s1600/DSCN1782.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j-6mLFn2wvE/UK_VUoDF0LI/AAAAAAAAB04/lD_H3x13W8E/s1600/DSCN1782.JPG" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>I'll leave a discussion of the physical&nbsp;characteristics&nbsp;of this site for another post. Today I want to share some of my observations from here, which I think demonstrate the tenacity of Glossy Buckthorn. In September of 2010, I marked 147 individual plants along three 30m transects in a field heavily infested with Glossy Buckthorn. &nbsp;This field was just one of several open fields in the area (along the Jackson Ski Touring trails, for those of you who are curious) that had a high density of buckthorn. &nbsp;I believe these areas are maintained as open fields to provide wildlife habitat for&nbsp;organisms&nbsp;such as moose.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OZlhHVEg7VQ/UK_YvwUAUYI/AAAAAAAAB1I/T-uek65Efgo/s1600/DSCN0899.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OZlhHVEg7VQ/UK_YvwUAUYI/AAAAAAAAB1I/T-uek65Efgo/s1600/DSCN0899.JPG" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Dense Glossy Buckthorn cover in an open field near Winniweta Falls Trailhead</td></tr></tbody></table>A little out of the field of view of the picture above, I set down one of my three 30m x 1m <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_transect" target="_blank">belt transects</a>, which &nbsp;contained 115 buckthorn plants. &nbsp;As you can see below, many of these plants are taller than my 2m measuring pole.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gm_REbjsARg/UK_aEB6um4I/AAAAAAAAB1Q/ts_cgvwBDv0/s1600/DSCN1021.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gm_REbjsARg/UK_aEB6um4I/AAAAAAAAB1Q/ts_cgvwBDv0/s1600/DSCN1021.JPG" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Transect 3 - Many buckthorn platns taller than my measuring pole!</td></tr></tbody></table>I&nbsp;received&nbsp;permission from the Forest Service to sample at this location, I even have a letter on official USFS letter head, so I was pretty confident that my site would go undisturbed after setting up my transects and tagging the plants. &nbsp;Plus, this isn't a high traffic area for hikers. &nbsp;But between my 2010 visit and my 2011 visit there were to major storms,&nbsp;including Hurricane Irene, that flooded the area, so I was expecting some impacts. &nbsp;But I was pretty shocked when I showed up the Fall of 2011 to this!<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WqruNWhlWac/UK_cYu9vqwI/AAAAAAAAB1Y/x-aiumPsDTM/s1600/DSCN1219.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WqruNWhlWac/UK_cYu9vqwI/AAAAAAAAB1Y/x-aiumPsDTM/s1600/DSCN1219.JPG" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Winn Falls site after mowing</td></tr></tbody></table>And here's that transect that had all of those greater than 2m tall plants.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zzAGDE6I0ZQ/UK_cn68yWgI/AAAAAAAAB1g/DE5dDWNHDoE/s1600/DSCN1221.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zzAGDE6I0ZQ/UK_cn68yWgI/AAAAAAAAB1g/DE5dDWNHDoE/s1600/DSCN1221.JPG" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Transect 3 - after mowing</td></tr></tbody></table>As it turns out, there was some miscommunication and this locale was approved for a mowing. &nbsp;It would be foolish to harbor any bitterness about a destroyed site. After all, the forest service is just trying to manage this invasive plant and keep this wildlife opening, well, open. &nbsp;But I do have to wonder if the mower thought twice about running over orange flags, plants marked in a line with flagging tape, or plants clearly marked with shining little&nbsp;metal&nbsp;tags. <br /><br />So, seeing this for what it was, I collected the tags I could find, measured the basal diameter of the plants who still had tags attached to them (hey, after all, that's a years worth of growth in basal diameter I could measure there, even if I couldn't say much about height), and left with the plan to come back in 2012 and see what happens. &nbsp;You see, buckthorn is notoriously tenacious - it&nbsp;re-sprouts&nbsp;quite readily. &nbsp;The most affective way to manage buckthorn is to cut it and immediately apply a weed killer (this is based on research reported in several papers, many from the Natural Areas Journal). &nbsp;I had a&nbsp;suspicion&nbsp;I would come back in a year and see plenty of re-growth. Of the 147 plants originally tagged, I was able to leave 44 and recover 45. &nbsp;That left 58 unaccounted for. &nbsp;Given how high the flood waters came from the two large storms that hit this area in 2011, I suspect that many of them are in the Ellis River or along its banks. This season I returned to Winn Falls and was tacken aback by the amount of re-growth.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CvUioBEOlFU/UK_gbFf7bMI/AAAAAAAAB1w/GfxZ24qQIjU/s1600/DSCN1784.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CvUioBEOlFU/UK_gbFf7bMI/AAAAAAAAB1w/GfxZ24qQIjU/s1600/DSCN1784.JPG" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Transect 3 - one year post mowing</td></tr></tbody></table>I haven't completely entered and analyzed these data, but taking a quick peak, about 5 of the 44 left were dead. Three more were missing. And it looks like on average there was about 40cm of re-growth. Also, many of them had multiple basal stems. I suspect returning next year I will find many of these with fruit on them.&nbsp;Ultimately, these data may not make into my population model. &nbsp;My sample size is very small (38 plants - lost 8 and gained 2 this year). But I think these data are still interesting. They make me wonder how affective a management strategy that involves cutting every couple of years can really be. Also, before the mowing, this field was a giant reservoir of Glossy Buckthorn seeds. &nbsp;I can't help but think about the role this reservoir might play in the spread of buckthorn into nearby logging sites or down river.
