My field sites are all within a day's drive of my home. Albeit it's a long day's drive to my sites in northern New Hampshire, but still, far easier to reach than some of my&nbsp;colleagues international field sites. &nbsp;&nbsp;Three of my field sites are right here on Long Island, less than 30 minutes from my office. &nbsp;I didn't necessarily pick my field sites out of convenience, but it's a nice bonus. &nbsp;After college I spent two-plus years working as a <a href="https://apply.coolworks.com/amc/job-details.asp?JobID=21423" target="_blank">Backcountry Caretaker</a> for the Appalachian Mountain Club in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. &nbsp;This experience, combined with numerous outdoor adventures throughout the northeast with my family during my childhood, instilled in me a deep love and appreciation for northeast&nbsp;deciduous and boreal forests. &nbsp;So, when I came to grad school&nbsp;to study ecology, I naturally migrated to a project that I could do in this forest type.<br /><br />Working close to home has many perks. &nbsp;For example, generally I can look at a weather forecast and pick the nicest days to head out to my sites. &nbsp;Generally I don't have to go out into the field during a down pour or a 100+ degree day. &nbsp;Not that I don't spend time in the field during crappy weather, but for my Long Island sites, I can usually avoid it. &nbsp;Another benefit is that I can go out to my sites just to satisfy my curiosity about field methods that pop into my head while I'm looking at my data. &nbsp;"I wonder if fruit count on these plants markedly differs in July versus August versus September?" Well, I can just head out and look at my plants. <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8ijWWvoCb_c/UA1ZWSGyGeI/AAAAAAAABzk/nTtQ_Bo8dgc/s1600/DSCN1669.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8ijWWvoCb_c/UA1ZWSGyGeI/AAAAAAAABzk/nTtQ_Bo8dgc/s1600/DSCN1669.JPG" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Counting fruit in July</td></tr></tbody></table>However, there are a few cons I've experienced with having field sites so close to home. &nbsp;For example, being so close to the office, I'm available to go to lab meetings, thesis defenses, random talks of interest, etc. &nbsp;These events seldom take more than a few hours a piece, but it's enough to eat into my field work time. &nbsp;Also, there's other projects I'm working on that feel more urgent at times - 'I can't go into the field today. I have to finish gathering data for project X!' <br /><br />For me, and for many others too, being successful at grad school requires good time management. &nbsp;Field work always requires time management, but having my field sites so nearby requires me to treat field visits like any other day-to-day task I have. &nbsp;I often talk about my 'field season' as though it's a discreet period of time, but in reality, &nbsp;it's really a portion of the year during which I shuffle in a few more tasks into my daily life.<br /><br /><u style="font-weight: bold;">Update:</u>&nbsp;Since I wrote this short post, another researcher has also written a great piece on doing local field work. I figured I'd link to it here:<br /><a href="http://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2013/08/28/in-praise-of-boring-local-field-sites/">http://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2013/08/28/in-praise-of-boring-local-field-sites/</a>
