## What is this "writing log" for?

Good question. For the most part I think it's a psychological trick I'm playing on myself. You see, based on advice offered in several places (e.g., [here](https://www.facultydiversity.org/14-day-challenge) and in [this book](https://www.apa.org/pubs/books/4441010)), I've been trying to foster a habit of daily writing. One thing that helps me with this is writing on projects that I version control with git and github. This is because seeing a block of [green boxes](https://github.com/mlammens) that indicate that I made consistent contributions over several days simply make me feel good. Actually, it goes long with the ["don't break the chain"](https://lifehacker.com/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret-281626) productivity idea. But some of my projects aren't on github, so I don't have a good way to track them. So here we are. I get to update this log, get my little green box, and feel good.
