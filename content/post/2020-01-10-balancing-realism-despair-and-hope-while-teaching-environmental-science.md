Thought about this post while running the TK trail. Frame it around three quotes, plus one.

One of my proudest moments as an environmental science teacher was watching a student throw her hands up in the air, then put her head down on the desk, while yelling "there's no easy answer!". 

Students can have a major effect on me when teaching env sci. 
This is less true when teach stats (until the end of the semester).
A cynical or an apathetic group can drive the class feel into despair, and drag me with it.
A group that focuses too much on realism, without hope, can quickly come to feeling stuck, which then can slide into despair.
I'm not sure what the problem with a group to focused on hope would be, because I've yet to experience it.

## Realism

Leopold quote


## Despair

Roosevelt quote

## Hope

StoryCorp story about having children as an act of hope.

## Plus one

Abbey quote about being half-hearted.

If we are in the twilight of human society as we know it, then I want to share the things I love with the people I love as often as I can.
