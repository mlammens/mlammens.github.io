I've just finished teaching [ENS 610 Environmental Science I](http://pace.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2018-2019/Graduate-Catalog/Course-Descriptions/ENS-Environmental-Science/600/ENS-610) for the fourth time, and so it seems like a good time to reflect on the course a bit and jot down some notes for next year. As in years past, this course runs simultaneously with [EP 603 Environmental Science for Policymakers](https://pace.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2018-2019/Graduate-Catalog/Course-Descriptions/EP-Environmental-Policy/600/EP-603). 

## Brief background

Some of my notes on this course can be found [here](https://github.com/mlammens/ENS-610).

## Matrials used this year

Repeating what I've done in the past, I required Rachel Carson's [Silent Spring](https://www.rachelcarson.org/SilentSpring.aspx), coupled with peer-reviewed journal articles for the first half of the semester.

For the second half, we read sections of various [IPCC Reports](https://www.ipcc.ch/reports/), including AR5, SR Climate Change and Land, and SR Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation.

## Major changes from years prior

* All readings were shared with a Zotero Group Project
* I assigned a Take-home midterm and final
* IPCC related readings for second "half" (instead of [Coal](https://www.amazon.com/Coal-Human-History-Barbara-Freese/dp/0465057934))

## Improvements for next year

* Apply the exam rubric separately to each question
* Expand the rubric for the final paper
* Setup more low-stakes writing assignments 
    * Require a draft
