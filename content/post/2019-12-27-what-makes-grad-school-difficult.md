It has been more than 10 years since I was a first-year PhD student in Ecology and Evolution, but I remember being sort of shocked by how "easy" the course content was during my first year in graduate school. Primarily the challenge seemed to be whether you could read, remember, and synthesize all that was being assigned. But unlike my undergraduate days, where I could spend 8 hours on a problem set, and only be marginally closer to understanding the topic, here time seemed to be my biggest constraint. When I teach environmental science at the graduate level now, I think this is largely true. Which is why there really isn't that large of a difference between my course content and that of a high school AP Environmental Science course. So what makes the grad course different?

One difference is the extent to which you are expected to synthesize information. 
I see this in my own writing from my time in grad school. 
My first "long" paper (about 10-15 pages on polyploidy in plants) is something I pull out from time-to-time just to remind myself of how poor my own writing was when I began grad school. 
Grammatically, it was fine. 
Not particularly concise or eloquent, but perfectly adequate. 
But what stands out is just how much the paper is just a collection of paragraphs, where each paragraph is a mini-review of a single paper related to the topic. 
I made no real effort to combine the information provided in each of the papers, synthesizing what is known about the topic. 
I didn't identify any major themes or gaps in knowledge.
What really strikes me is I was reading a *ton* of papers, and while not a single one of them read as poorly as mine, it never occurred to me to do anything different. 

I think it's hard to teach students to synthesize, but I try a few things in my courses to help get them there.
I assign weekly reading response writing assignments. 
These are short, 300 - 500 words, and include a prompt question or idea. 
They are fairly low-stakes (individually not worth a lot and graded mostly based wheather they were completed or not). 
For the term paper, I have them do an annotated bibliography.
In some ways, this may seem like a novice approach, but it helps them connect key ideas from the individual papers.
