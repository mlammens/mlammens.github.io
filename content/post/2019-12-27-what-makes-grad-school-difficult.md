It has been more than 10 years since I was a first-year PhD student in Ecology and Evolution, but I remember being sort of shocked how "easy"" the course content was during my first year in graduate school. Primarily the challange seemed to be whether you could read, remember, and synthesize all that was being assigned. But unlike my undergraduate days, where I could spend 8 hours on a problem set, and only be marginally closer to understanding the topic, here time seemed to be my biggest contraint. When I teach environmental science at the graduate level now, I think this is largely true. Which is why there really isn't that large of a difference between my course content and that of a high school AP Environmental Science course. So what makes the grad course different?
