Last Wednesday, March 3, 2021, I had a chance to present some of my research at the Haub School of Law's Faculty Development Workshop. 
I sent a draft of a manuscript I'm co-writing with one of my grad students (the student is first author) regarding using species distribution models in local management decisions a few days ahead of time, then gave a 20 minute presentation on the topic. 
After my presentation, we had a Q&A / discussion. 
This manuscript is the culmination of a NYS DEC Hudson Estuary Program grant I received several years ago to study the potential role of road culverts in connecting amphibian and reptile habitat.
(I'm planning on doing more work with culverts in the future, but this will wrap up this first project. I submitted the final project report to the state about 1.5 years ago.)
