Hi, I'm Matt Aiello-Lammens

I'm an ecologist, currently working as a post-doc 
in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Connecticut
with John Silander, and many others. My current research focuses on examining trait by
environment relationships of plant communities in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) of 
South Africa, and the processes involved in assembly of these communities. Prior to this, I go my Ph.D. under the guidance of H. Resit Akcakaya in the Department of Ecology 
and Evolution at Stony Brook University. My dissertation research was mostly in the 
areas of population ecology and invasion biology. I also participated in several projects
focused on conservation biology related questions. A common theme in my research is 
that I develop new analysis tools and techniques that help answer questions in ecology 
and conservation biology. I have focused on particularly challenging aspects of 
population modeling, including appropriately modeling biological processes such as 
density dependence and addressing the computational challenges of carrying-out 
global sensitivity analyses. Currently I am working on methods applied to community 
assembly and understanding trait by environment relationships. When not doing research, 
I like to spend time outside hiking, climbing, biking, etc., preferably with my wife
and daughter.
