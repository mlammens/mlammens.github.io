Here are sites I also work on from time-to-time:

* [My Biostats site](https://mlammens.github.io/Biostats) - I put materials and thoughts related to biostats here. Most of these materials are in support of classes I teach.

* [My plant ID log](http://ecologistatwork.blogspot.com/) - When I have the time, I like to write about my process of becoming a better plant ecologist, which mostly means identifying plants right now.
